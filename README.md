# Efficient-Deepfake-Detection-MobileNetV3-ECA-KD

A lightweight deepfake detection model based on MobileNetV3, optimised for real-time mobile and edge deployment. The model replaces Squeeze-and-Excitation with Efficient Channel Attention (ECA) to reduce parameters by over 50%, and applies knowledge distillation from a ConvNeXt teacher to preserve accuracy.
